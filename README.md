## Learning Goals

This project was given to the developers to enforce their understanding of Redux and how it is integrated into an app in a smart, effective manner. In addition, the developer was to ensure their understanding of how to test all parts of Redux, including actions, thunks, reducers, and mapStateToProps/mapDispatchToProps.
