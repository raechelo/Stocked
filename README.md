# Stocked 🥘

Stocked is an app that gives users the opportunity to search recipes for ingredients that are already in their kitchen. Simply choose your ingredients and click go to see your results! If you see a recipe you really like, double click on the card to favorite it. In addition to favoriting a recipe, you can view the recipe on the page where it was originally published as well and viewing a Youtube video for that recipe.

The app is available [here](https://master.d2me17v7trg2a3.amplifyapp.com/).

## Learning Goals 🥡

This project was given to the developers to enforce their understanding of Redux and how it is integrated into an app in a smart, effective manner. In addition, the developer was to ensure their understanding of how to test all parts of Redux, including actions, thunks, reducers, and mapStateToProps/mapDispatchToProps.
